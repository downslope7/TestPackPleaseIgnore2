**This is the file that ModpackTweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Greetings everyone, and welcome to...~
~
 §oTest Pack~
        Please Ignore§r!~
~
We are very excited to finally be releasing the pack to the public.~
~
We couldn't have done this without the FTB subreddit community, who were integral in shaping this pack to be what you are playing now.~
~
Thank you all so very much for making TPPI possible!
~~~
So, your first question probably is,~
~
  "§oWhat is this book?§r"~
~
Well, this book you're reading is added by our own custom mod,~
~
~
   §4M§co§6d§2p§1a§5c§4k §cT§6w§2e§1a§5k§4s§c!§r
~~~
§4M§co§6d§2p§1a§5c§4k §cT§6w§2e§1a§5k§4s§0 is what allows us to give you the book you are currently reading, as well as many other useful features.~
~
Should you want a new copy of this book, there is a recipe in NEI.~
~~~
§4T§cP§6P§2I §1T§5w§4e§ca§6k§2s§0 is another custom mod we use, which helps us customize recipes and add other compatability between mods.~
~
Using both configs and §4T§cP§6P§2I §1T§5w§4e§ca§6k§2s§0 allows us to heavily configure this pack to our liking.
~~~
The changes that have been made are not to make the game harder, but to extend the life of a single world.~
~
The end goal of the pack is to make sure that no one path is superior to any other.~
~~~
To see a full list of tweaked recipes, type "Tweaked" in NEI.~
~
To see the remaining list of things that are tweaked (not recipes), you can find that at the end of this book.~
~~~
Another feature of §4M§co§6d§2p§1a§5c§4k §cT§6w§2e§1a§5k§4s§0 is the in-game commands it adds.~
~
The changelog can be found by typing §l/tppi changelog§r, which will of course always be up to date, no need to ever get a new copy.~
~
There is also a system in place to receieve ingame documentation for most mods in the pack.~
~
Type §l/tppi guide§r to receive an all-around guide to the mods in the pack, the easiest way to obtain any info you wish.~
~~~
Type §l/tppi mods <modname>§r to get an individual book for a mod, or to get a link if the mod has not had in-game documentation written for it yet.~
~
§l/tppi mods list§r will give you a list of all mods that are possible to be used in the command.
~~~
Naturally, this is a big job, and it's not yet finished, but we're getting close!~
~
Our community is already getting involved in documenting these mods via our mod's system.~
~~~
If you'd like to help out with this documentation project or any other parts of TPPI's development, feel free to type the command §l/getInvolved§r to learn more.
~~~
Lastly, TPPI uses a very heavily modified ore generation system.~
~
To check it out, type §l/ores§r for an ore generation guide book.
~~~
~
     That's about it.~
~
~
~
~
        Have fun!

~~~
TWEAKED ITEMS~
~
Please note that most of these items are listed here because they are DISABLED.~
~
For balance tweaks, check recipes in NEI.~
~~~
Auto-Output Upgrade (Advanced Genetics - Prevents crashing)~
~
Iron->Iridum in the MT (Advanced Solars - Balance)~
~
Titanium->Chrome in the MT (Advanced Solars - Balance)~
~
Spatial IO stuff (AE - Unstable)~
~~~
Bibliocraft can only make 2 copies using one plate and uses more XP (Balance, discourages exploit)~
~
Pixies and Phantom mobs are disabled (BoP)~
~
Force Shears (Dartcraft - Prevents crash on servers)~
~
Portal Guns cannot be found in dungeon loot, you must craft it (Portal Gun - Balance)~
~~~
Hammering of non-basic plates using the forge hammer is disabled (Gregtech/IC2 - Basic=Gold, Iron, Copper, etc.. Non-basic=Stainless Steel, Titanium, etc.. Balance)~
~
Uncrafting Table (Twilight Forest - Prevents known and probably unknown exploits)~
~
Power requirement for LP is off (Encourages it over AE)~
~
Morph Abilities are off (Use Advanced Genetics)~
~~~
Project:RED mechanical module (Identical to LP..)~
~
Time Torch (Dartcraft - Balance)~
~
Repair enchantment on infusing Dartcraft stuff (Balance - Repair isn't intended for everything and shouldn't be able to be applied on these extremely powerful weapons/armour)~
~
All AM2 mobs except Mana Creepers and Mages are disabled. Flickers still exist, of course. (Lag, annoyance. To summon nature guardian, we added a recipe for its spawn egg)~
~~~
Removed Flight from Advanced Genetics (Obvious balance reasons - controversial, but necessary to keep various mod items from being made completely obsolete)~
~
Removed More Health Option from Advanced Genetics (Stacks improperly with TiC hearts, leading to massive amounts of health)~
~
Ethereal Processor from ElectroMagicTools (Prevents dupes with GT)~
~~~
If we've forgotten anything, let us know on our IRC channel!~
~
We can be reached at irc.esper.net, in channel #TPPI.~
~
Thanks, and have fun!~
